🎬 Seaborn & Linear Regression Movie Analysis
This project explores and visualizes movie data using Seaborn and applies Linear Regression to examine the relationship between production budgets and worldwide gross revenue. The goal is to uncover trends, outliers, and actionable insights from historical movie data, ideal for data science learning and business analytics.

🧩 Project Objectives

Analyze the relationship between production budgets and global box office revenue

Identify trends in budget allocation and movie profitability over time

Explore outliers such as movies with high budgets and $0 gross

Visualize insights using clear and aesthetically pleasing plots

Apply linear regression to evaluate predictive trends in revenue



📁 Data Source


The dataset consists of the following key columns:

Release_Date: Year and date of release

Movie_Title: Title of the film

USD_Production_Budget: Total production cost

USD_Worldwide_Gross: Global earnings

USD_Domestic_Gross: U.S. earnings

Additional metadata for filtering and categorization

All data was loaded, cleaned, and analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python.



🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy): Data loading, transformation

Seaborn & Matplotlib: Exploratory and regression visualizations

Scikit-learn: Linear regression modeling

Google Colab: Development and analysis environment



📈 Key Insights
🍿 Most Expensive Flop: Singularity with $175M budget and $0 return

🧨 Total Films with $0 Gross: 357 (including Aquaman, A Wrinkle in Time)

🕗 Trend: Increased budgets and returns post-2000

📉 Observation: Many high-budget films didn’t perform well globally

📊 Linear Regression: Shows moderate positive correlation between budget and revenue



📊 Dashboard Features
